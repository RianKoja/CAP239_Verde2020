Repository for the Green/Purple group work for CAP239 "Computational Mathematics", 2020 class.

# Running the project
Most of the analysis performed can be run by simply executing the `Entry.py` script located on `src` directory with python 3.7. The required modules are listed in `src/requirements.txt`.

A few analysis based on neural networks were performed on Google Colab with a notebook, available on the root directory named `RNN_To_COVID19_Predictions.ipynb`.
