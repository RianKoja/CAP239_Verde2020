# Project Description

Explain what should be done or expected for each project here.

There should be a file "requirements.txt" with particular python modules that need to be pip installed.

The entry point for the program should be "Entry.py"

This project should be run in a docker container, by calling `bash run.sh src` in the upper level folder. Here `src` is the folder name, so other projects can be added
